- 👋 Hi, I’m @vitojr
- 👀 I’m interested in math and javascript programming. I am currently writing a calculator program in javascript using math.js which I am very impressed with. I would like to add to my program a function that solves nth degree polynomials. So now I am at a point where I want to try out complex.js. I placed <script src="complex.js"></script> in my html code, but it doesn't seem to work. However, using <script src="https://unpkg.com/mathjs@9.4.4/lib/browser/math.js"> works fine for math.js. Any help with this issue would be greatly appreciated.
- 🌱 I also want to learn more about Laplace Transforms. I know how it works, but now I want to know why it works.
- 💞️ My calculator can be found at www.math-philosophy.xyz/calcpp.html
